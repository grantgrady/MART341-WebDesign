# Assignment 4: Web Development Concepts

## How Do Web Browsers Work?
Web browsers process and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They use rendering engines to turn code into a visual webpage. The browser requests files from a web server and displays the final product.

## What is the DOM?
The DOM is a webpage structured like a tree of elements. JavaScript can change the DOM to change content, making the webpages interactive.

## What Are the Four Essential Elements of an HTML Page?
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Declares the document type.
2. `<html>` - The root element.
3. `<head>` - Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
4. `<body>` - Contains visible page content.
