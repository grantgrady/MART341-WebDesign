      <h2>How I’ve Changed</h2>
      <p>At the start of this class, I barely understood how websites were built. I struggled to organize my files and often got confused just linking a stylesheet. Now, I can confidently create a full webpage from scratch. I understand how HTML and CSS work together, and I’ve learned how to troubleshoot without panicking. I can use GitHub and VS Code efficiently, and I feel way more capable overall. This class forced me to figure things out and helped me realize I actually enjoy building things like this.</p>
