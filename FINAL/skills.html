      <h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
      <p>YouTube carried and helped make my workflow smoother ,, without it Iâ€™d have been doomed. Every time I got stuck, I found someone who explained the solution clearly. Watching others code helped me better understand the process, and become a literal demigod at coding. It became one of my most valuable learning tools throughout the course.</p>
