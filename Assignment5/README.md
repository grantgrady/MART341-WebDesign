One class I really enjoyed was History of Rock n ROll. Although the teacher was strict, his knowldge on the subject amazed me and kept me captivated everrday.
## Reflection

- I used the `width` property to keep the layout organized.
- The design is simple and easy to read.
- I removed extra styles to keep it clean.
- The final layout turned out as expected.
- I didn’t use float/margin since an image wasn’t required.
